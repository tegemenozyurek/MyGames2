        <h1>Welcome to R.exe Games Website!</h1>
        <p>R.exe Games is a game company prototype started 
            by Turgut Egemen Özyürek in 2022. Egemen, our one and only
            team member, creates projects on his own or with a little help
            from others. He shares them with his family and friends, 
            proudly featuring the R.exe Games logo and a dash of love.</p>

            <div class="right"><h1>Boost</h1>
                <p class="gameReview">The goal of the game Boost is to guide your rocket from 
                    the starting point to the landing spot without hitting
                    any obstacles. It's not easy! Use the A and D keys to
                    change the rocket's direction, and press SPACE to give
                    it a boost. There are 10 levels, and you only have 3
                    lives to complete them. If you lose all 3 lives, you
                    have to start over. 
                    This game holds significant value for R.exe among our
                    projects. It stands out as our only 3D game, the first 
                    one to incorporate sound effects, our initial fully 
                    playable game, and the first one we released online, 
                    making it one of our most valuable creations.</p></div>

            <div class="right"><h1>Pingu's Fish</h1>
            <p class="gameReview">"Pingu's Fish" is the most popular game made by R.exe Games. 
                It's a simple and enjoyable game that anyone, even those who haven't played 
                games before, can easily play and love. The game has calming music in the 
                background, gentle sound effects, uncomplicated graphics that don't strain 
                the eyes, and easy gameplay. The goal of the game is to survive by moving Pingu 
                left with the A key and right with the D key, avoiding snowballs falling from above. 
                You also need to collect fish to increase your score and grab falling lives to stay 
                alive longer. The main aim is to achieve the highest score.</p></div>

            <div class="right"><h1>Samurai Blade</h1>
            <p class="gameReview">"Samurai Blade" is a game we made quickly, all done at Heidelberg University
                in Germany. In the game, your samurai has to dodge endless sawblades coming
                randomly from two spawners above and bouncing off the walls. The only way
                to destroy these deadly sawblades is to jump over them and safely land back
                on the ground. Each destroyed sawblade adds 1 to your score, and the goal 
                is to get the highest score. The key move in the game is the double jump. 
                Use it wisely, guess well where the sawblades are going, and jump over them to stay alive.</p></div>

            <div class="right"><h1>2 Prince 1 Crown</h1>
            <p class="gameReview">"2 Prince 1 Crown" is a game created in 48 hours for the Yaşar University Mobile 
                App Development Student Club GameJam (MUG GameJam). In this project, 2 artists
                and 1 developer from R.exe worked together to complete a game with a "competition"
                theme. The game is a split-screen beat 'em up where two players try to stay alive
                by defeating three different creatures that randomly appear on the screen.
                Players can collect power-ups to improve their abilities and use power-downs
                to slow down and freeze their opponent. They can also drop rocks and objects
                on their opponent by manipulating the environment.</p></div>

            <div class="right"><h1>Ice Hockey 2D</h1>
            <p class="gameReview">"Ice Hockey 2D" was created by R.exe Games in just 3 hours. 
                The game is designed for 2 players. At the beginning of the game, the puck moves 
                in a random direction. Both players try to defend their goals by moving them up 
                and down. Although the puck starts relatively slow, it accelerates with each player 
                or wall contact, making it challenging for players to defend their goals. 
                The player who reaches a score of 3 wins the match.</p></div>

            <div class="right"><h1>Pixel Dungeons</h1>
            <p class="gameReview">Pixel Dungeons is a rogue-lite game still in development. 
                It's planned to be released around the middle of 2024. 
                In the game, after clearing monsters in a dungeon, 
                you choose one of three doors to develop your character 
                and try to go as far as you can. The goal is to give players 
                a different experience each time based on their choices. 
                The game aims to be released on a public platform by the end of 2024. </p></div>
